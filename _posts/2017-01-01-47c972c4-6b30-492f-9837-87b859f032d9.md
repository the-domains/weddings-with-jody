  "Rev. Jody Lotito Levine is an exceptional officiant, but above all she is an
  extraordinarily warm and genuine soul! Initially my fiance and I had found her
  by chance (here on Wedding Wire), but by the end of our journey, we both KNEW
  that Jody was destined to bless us and our marriage. Jody's kind,
  understanding and loving demeanor quickly pulled us in. She is patient and
  listened to our every word...our every sentiment. Jody was always available
  and was truly interested in getting to know us, our love story. She felt it
  within her to represent our love in the most honorable, respectful, beautiful
  and unique of ceremonies. Her guidance has been remarkable, and we know this
  to be true due to her compassionate, caring and easy-going nature. Through our
  meetings, prior to our wedding day, the three of us found an irreplaceable and
  special interconnectedness. Her presence was duly noted during and after our
  ceremony as our guests had many compliments about Jody. They told us that her
  words were both soft and alluring and her spirit bright and sincere! Trust in
  me when I say it was absolutely a ceremony to remember! In Jody, not only did
  we find an outstanding officiant, but we also found a heartfelt friend."
