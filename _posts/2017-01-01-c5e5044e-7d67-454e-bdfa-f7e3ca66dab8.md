  "We could not have found a better person to marry us than Rev. Jody Lotito
  Levine! She has such wonderful energy and insight, a clear understanding of
  love and all that goes with it! Mind you we didnt give her much to go on, and
  she did a fantastic job at pulling it all together. Everyone was very
  impressed with her and told us afterwards it was the most authentic and
  genuine wedding/civil union that they had ever witnessed. We really owe that
  to Rev. Jody, she made everyone laugh and cry tears of joy. My husband and I
  highly recommend her."
