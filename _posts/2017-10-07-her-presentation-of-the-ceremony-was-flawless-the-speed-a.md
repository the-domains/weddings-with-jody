  “Her presentation of the ceremony was flawless - the speed at which she spoke
  - carefully and deliberately and with honest feeling for us as people - came
  through and moved everyone in the room. Her humor and heartfelt caring for us
  and the importance of our decision to marry created an atmosphere of love and
  exuberance for us and our guests that we will never forget. She is a wonderful
  and positive spirit who I can't say enough good things about!”
