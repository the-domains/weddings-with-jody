  "Andy and I had a great experience working with Jody, from the first emails
  all the way to our wedding day! Her warmth and compassion comes through in all
  that she does. She went beyond what we expected from an officiant, for our
  first meeting we spent nearly 3 hours chatting and getting to know one
  another. She made us feel very comfortable with her creative process, and we
  felt we were involved in the designing of our ceremony. We've had many friends
  and family members compliment the ceremony saying it was personal and
  touching, and we couldn't agree more! Thank you, Jody, for helping to make our
  wedding day so special!"
