# A little more about my work.

I am an ordained Interfaith and Interspiritual Minister who has been officiating weddings, vow renewels, memorials, and baby blessings for over 10 years from coast to coast and around the world. I am also a spiritual counselor and parent coach who services individuals, couples and families. I have married heterosexual and same sex couples in formal and informal settings of 4 to 400, indoor and outdoor, casual and formal in a wide variety of venues. Iʼve done countless weddings in NYC, along the waterfront in Jersey City and Hoboken, where I live, as well as in the Hudson Valley, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Florida and abroad.

Most of my ceremonies are about 20 minutes from processional to recessional, though Iʼve done shorter and longer. Generally, they are spiritual, not religious, in that they acknowledge marriage as a sacred journey where we can fully express ourselves, as individuals and in partnership. I have an extensive background in events and hospitality which rounds off my offerings. My work is a calling and a passion. I believe in the power of love to transform our world and I am changed in some profound way by each person and couple who crosses my path.
