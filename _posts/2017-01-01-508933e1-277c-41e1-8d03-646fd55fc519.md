  "Jody was our best find for our wedding! She did an absolute amazing job
  creating a ceremony that matched our ideas of what our ceremony would be. Jody
  took the time to talk with us and really get to know my husband and I. She was
  able to make our ceremony personal, but still balanced faith and emphasized
  our love story. My husband and I got so many compliments on our ceremony from
  our family members and friends."
