!["Reverend Jody was absolutely amazing. The ceremony that she created for us was so personal and wonderfully written. She was so lovely to work with and her genuine love for what she does shows in every step of the process. She truly listened to who we are and created a service that we will never forget. We are so grateful to have had the chance to be married by her and we would HIGHLY recommend to her anyone looking for a truly personalized and meaningful ceremony."](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/60569a4b-268c-4425-9789-25b899d95b5a.jpg)
