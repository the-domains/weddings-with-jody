  "There's something about Jody that makes you feel like she is part of your
  family even after only knowing her for a short time. After our initial Skype
  conversation with Jody, my wife and I decided we felt pretty good about
  choosing Jody to preside over our wedding ceremony. When it came time to write
  the ceremony itself, Jody invited us to her home for coffee and conversation.
  I don't think I will ever forget how I felt leaving Jody's house that day. My
  wife and I are generally very hesitant to share our feelings with anyone, but
  somehow we opened up to Jody. Walking back to my car, I was completely
  confident that we had made the right choice with Jody. Leading up to our
  wedding day we worked with Jody to write a truly personal ceremony. On our big
  day Jody was everywhere she needed to be and the wedding ceremony was
  flawless.


  Jody is a professional and a fantastic writer. But more importantly, she was
  able to connect personally with Roxanne and me. I think, if I had to give
  advice to couples looking for an officiant, find someone you can connect
  emotionally with. Your wedding ceremony should be filled with emotion, namely
  the love between you and your partner, and the love your family and friends
  have for the two of you. Jody has an undeniable talent in bringing that
  emotion out, and understanding how you and your partner feel about each other
  on a very deep level. I would recommend Jody without reservation.


  Jody, thank you for being an important part of the best day of my life."
