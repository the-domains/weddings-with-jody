  "I was married Dec 3, 2016 and could not have been more pleased to have chosen
  Rev. Jody to be our officiant! She helped make the process of creating a
  ceremony and writing our vows easy and stress free. I am frequently described
  as 'Type A' and Jody made me feel secure through the whole process; I knew
  what to expect when and she was always following up with me before I ever had
  to ask her for anything. She is very kind, sweet and funny. She meet with my
  husband and I a few times before the wedding so that we could get to know each
  other, and from these meetings she wrote a personal ceremony that was very us
  and our friends and family loved it. After the ceremony text was finalized she
  advised me not to look at it again before the wedding so it would be 'fresh'
  on the day of. Probably some of the best advice I received as it made me so
  much more present in our ceremony and it was new and special all over again. I
  could not recommend her more highly!"
