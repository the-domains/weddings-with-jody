title: A little more about me and LOVE.
publisher: {}
description: >-
  Simply put, I live from my heart and am in love with LOVE - in all forms,
  shapes and sizes - in itʼs ever evolving uniqueness that breathes life into
  each moment. What a gift it is to love and be loved and pass it on in the
  myriad of ways we come together to experience our lives. It is no surprise to
  those who know me that I express myself personally and professionally through
  punctuating acts of love. I am also a passionate mom, consummate professional,
  and treasured friend. I am an artist and a taskmaster, a caring, tender and
  fierce human. I am a writer and a deep listener who has an uncanny and learned
  ability to reflect back the truth. I am committed to falling in love with
  myself every day, regardless of trial or tribulation, and I invite you to do
  the same. Love is messy and so are we. Love is beautiful and so are we. Love
  is pure and unlimited potential and so are we! I am an avid practitioner of
  yoga and meditation. I love the weave of friendship and food and good
  conversation. I am insatiably curious about the meaning of life and how to
  shine our light in the world. I love to laugh. I feel my way through each day
  and am keenly aware that every moment is precious and every person who crosses
  my life a gift. You are a gift which I hope to share.
